# Welcome to Aurora Vehicle type detection Project!

This web application utilizes the cutting-edge YOLOv8 object detection model to instantly recognize and classify vehicles in images

We applied YOLOv8, the latest iteration of the You Only Look Once algorithm, in this project.
This  model has been trained to identify five key vehicle classes:
1.Cars
2.Buses
3.Trucks
4.Motorcycles
5.Ambulances

Althought the accuracy of best.pt model is not very high because of the train data quality, you can try example in streamlit_app.py or check the source code for model training in model training folder.
